"MedicationDispenseIHEMM","","","",0,*,"","","","","[IHE MM] Logical Model for medication dispense","A medication dispense relates to zero or one prescription item of one prescription. There are cases when a medication is dispensed before the prescription is created. Medications dispensed outside the context of any prescription are considered as self-prescribed by the professional who dispenses. Thus they are still attached to a pseudo-prescription. A medication dispense is issued by one pharmacy staff. It is related to zero (community use case) or one (hospital use case) encounter of care.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"",""
